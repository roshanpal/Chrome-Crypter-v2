# Chrome-Crypter-v2
Chrome crypter is a tool to encrypt executables and load them directly to memory on client system, bypassing the antivirus detection.

This is 10 year old code and I haven't touched it for a long time. So it might need some updates to compile with latest .NET SDK. I found the project in my old hard drive. It might be useful for someone planning to learn techniques of bypassing antivirus detection.
